# Documentation Guidelines

This document provides best practices and guidelines for organizing, naming, and managing project-related documents to ensure consistency and ease of access.


##  General Company Documentation Guidelines

1. Use a clear directory structure. Organize documents by category or project module:
   - Example:
     - `hr/`
     - `finance/`
1. Use folders for document file types:
    For example: 
   - `PDFs`
   - `DOCX`
   - `PPTX`
   - `Excel`
1. Follow consistent naming conventions:
   - Use Title Case letters and hyphens (`-`) or space (` `) to separate words (e.g., `Project-Plan.docx` , `Risk Assessment.docx`).
   - Include a descriptive name and date (e.g., `Project-Plan-for-DigiXess.docx`).

1. Avoid appending version numbers to filenames. Instead, use a version control system to track changes.

1. **Document Structure**: Use a consistent structure for all documents, including sections like Introduction, Purpose, Scope, actual content, and Conclusion.

   **Example Structure**:
   - **Page Header and Footer**:
     - **Company Logo**: Place the company logo at the top of each page.
     - **Document Title**: Clearly state the document title.
     - **Version Number**: Include the version number in the header or footer.
     - **Page Number**: Add page numbers for easy reference.
     - **Confidentiality Notice**: Include a confidentiality notice if applicable.
   - **Cover Page**:
     - **Title and Subtitle**: Clear and descriptive.
     - **Latest Version**: Indicate the latest version at the top or bottom of the document.
     - **Author**: Specify who created or updated the document.
     - **Last Updated Date**: Always include the most recent update date.
   - **Table of Contents**: Provide a list of sections and subsections for easy navigation.
   - **Purpose**: Explain the purpose of the document in detail.
   - **Scope**: Define the boundaries and intended audience of the document.
   - **Content**: Include the main body with relevant details, data, or instructions.
   - **Conclusion**: Summarize key points and outline next steps.
   - **Appendix**: Add supplementary information, references, or resources.
   - **Version History**: Maintain a record of changes and updates to the document.

1. **Formatting**: Use headings, bullet points, and tables to improve readability. Maintain consistent font styles and sizes throughout the document.

1. **Quality Standards**:
   All company docs shall have the following quality standards:
   - Clear and Concise  (simple language, no jargon unless necessary).
   - Accurate (verified by SMEs or stakeholders)
   - Ensure technical relevance by providing clear explanations or definitions for technical terms, acronyms, and jargons
   - Professional (no typos, clear formatting)
   - Actionable (especially for SOPs and training materials)
